# DownwardDescent
This contains the source code to a game I wrote around 6 months ago by the name of Downward Descent.
The game was a 2-month long personal project of mine, I wrote all of it in Python. I made sure to have it
be (hopefully) cross platform. So, if you have Python installed on your machine, you should be able to 
play the game. To play it, start up the program called 'Downward_Descent.py'. 
I don't mind if you freely distrubute the program- as long as you credit me as the author of the work and
try not to say `you wrote it`. I DID put some effort into this afterall.
Hope you enjoy!

Backstory: Why did I make it?
=============================
I made Downward Descent (in the beginning) mostly as a test. I had been looking into the old 80's game
called Rogue (which started the genere `Rogue-Like` so I was wondering if I could implement my own game
from almost complete scratch in Python. What at the time was a simple question of: "Hey, can I even figure
out how to manage these graphics- get input and make `collision detection`" turned into a full on game.
